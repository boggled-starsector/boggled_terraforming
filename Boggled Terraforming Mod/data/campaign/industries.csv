STELLAR_MIRROR_ARRAY,Stellar Mirror Array,1,1,0,1,,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/stellar_mirror.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Stellar_Mirror_Array,"An array of orbital mirrors that rapidly increase surface temperatures. Improves habitability and farming conditions. Cannot raise temperatures without strong light from a nearby star, and may require additional infrastructure to terraform planets that lack sufficient water-ice to create an Earth-like environment.",
STELLAR_SHADE_ARRAY,Stellar Shade Array,1,1,0,1,,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/stellar_shade.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Stellar_Shade_Array,"An array of orbital shades that rapidly decrease surface temperatures. Improves habitability and farming conditions. Cannot counteract heating caused by volcanism or tidal forces, and may require additional infrastructure to terraform planets that lack sufficient water-ice to create an Earth-like environment.",
ISMARA_SLING,Ismara's Sling,1,1,0,1,,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/mass_driver.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Ismara_Sling,"Installs a network of gigantic mass drivers on the surface of the planet that can launch water-filled projectiles towards other worlds for terraforming purposes. It was designed by copying one of the few remaining mass drivers built on Ismara by the Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation before the Collapse. Can only be built on cryovolanic or water-covered worlds, and can only help terraform worlds in the same system.",
MILITARY_POLICE_HEADQUARTERS,Military Police Headquarters,1,1,0,1,,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/military_police_headquarters.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Military_Police_Headquarters,"Establishes a new paramilitary branch of the security forces with the mission of pacifying the criminal gangs and separatist groups residing on the fringes of civilization. Will eventually bring all the inhabitants of the planet under central government control, including any decivilized subpopulations, if provided with sufficient troops and equipment.",
