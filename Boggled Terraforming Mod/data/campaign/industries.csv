STELLAR_MIRROR_ARRAY,Stellar Mirror Array,200,180,0,100,,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/stellar_mirror.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Stellar_Mirror_Array,"An array of orbital mirrors that rapidly increase surface temperatures. Improves various conditions depending on the type of world. May require additional infrastructure to terraform arid planets that lack sufficient water-ice to create an Earth-like environment.",
STELLAR_SHADE_ARRAY,Stellar Shade Array,200,180,0,100,,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/stellar_shade.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Stellar_Shade_Array,"An array of orbital shades that rapidly decrease surface temperatures. Improves various conditions depending on the type of world. Cannot counteract heating caused by volcanism or tidal forces, and may require additional infrastructure to terraform arid planets that lack sufficient water-ice to create an Earth-like environment.",
ISMARA_SLING,Ismara's Sling,100,180,0,50,,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/mass_driver.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Ismara_Sling,"Installs a network of gigantic mass drivers on the surface of the planet that can launch water-filled projectiles towards other worlds for terraforming purposes. It was designed by copying one of the few remaining mass drivers built on Ismara by the Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation before the Collapse. Can only help terraform worlds in the same system.",
MILITARY_POLICE_HEADQUARTERS,Military Police Headquarters,20,60,0,10,,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/military_police_headquarters.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Military_Police_Headquarters,"Establishes a new paramilitary branch of the security forces with the mission of pacifying the criminal gangs and separatist groups residing on the fringes of civilization. Will eventually bring all the inhabitants of the planet under central government control, including any decivilized subpopulations, if provided with sufficient troops and equipment.",
ATMOSPHERE_ADJUSTER,Atmosphere Adjuster,100,120,0,100,,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/atmosphere_adjuster.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Atmosphere_Adjuster,"A network of towering constructs that spew various particles into the atmosphere. Will eventually make the atmosphere Earth-like enough for a terran biosphere to take hold. Without a dedicated nanoforge to rapidly produce the necessary materials, terraforming will take a considerable amount of time.",
